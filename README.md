# ChromeExtension-DownloadsOrganizer
## Description 
This chrome extension puts your download in the appropriate folder based on file type. For eg. jpeg/jpg will go into Images folder and "mp3/wav" files will go into Audio folder. You can update or add mapping by editing the config.json (this file contains the mapping from filetypes to desirable path)

## How to use the extension:
1) Go to chrome://extensions and toggle Developer mode (located at the top right corner)
2) Use the load unpacked button and select the path for the extension
3) Download any file and it should go into the mapped folder
